Possible Testing Tasks:
    -Memory Game
    -Arithmetic
    -Algebra
Baseline Models:
    -Regular RNN,LSTM,GRU, NN
    -Non-Bounded Sequential Models
    -Transformers??

Basic Idea:
    -Allow for specialization of weight sections
    -Allow for more complex thought through a non-constant computation time
    -Optimize the learning ability of agents.

COMPLETED:
    Baseline Model!
    FIRST MODEL

TODO:
    implement model with ac
    implement model with pooling vector
    train model
